## Short introduction

MIMS-unit is abbreviated for _Monitor Independent Movement Summary_ unit. This measurement is developed to harmonize the processing of accelerometer data from different devices. You may refer to the [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1123/jmpb.2018-0068) for the detail description of the algorithm.

## Copyright and citation

The copyright of the work belongs to Northeastern University, [mHealth Research Group](https://www.mhealthgroup.org/). Please kindly [cite the manuscript](https://mhealthgroup.github.io/MIMSunit/authors.html) if you have used the package or referred to the algorithm in your work.

## Shiny Demo App

You may try to compute MIMS-unit values using our shiny demo app https://qutang.shinyapps.io/MIMSunit/. Note that the upload file size limit is 50 MB. The usage quote for the server is limited, so we do not guarantee the web app is always available to you.

## Datasets

All datasets used in the manuscript are available at https://mhealthgroup.github.io/MIMSunit/articles/datasets.html.

## System Requirements

1. R (>= 3.6.0)
2. memory (> 4GB)

### For Windows

Rtools >=3.5 (see: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)

### For Linux (use ubuntu as an example)

Install dependency system packages for `devtools`: `build-essential`, `libcurl4-gnutls-dev`, `libxml2-dev`, `libssl-dev`, `libcurl4-ssl-dev`. 

## Installation

### Stable version 

CRAN

```r
install.packages('MIMSunit')
```

### Development version

Github

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mhealthgroup/MIMSunit")
```
  
_Note: It is recommended to use Rstudio when installing the package, because `devtools` has some compatible issues with R command line interface._

## Usage

```r
MIMSunit::mims_unit(input_dataframe, dynamic_range=c(-3,3), epoch='1 min')
```

Assume the input dataframe is in following format, with the first column (timestamp) in `POSXlct` objects and the device used to collect this data has dynamic range being -3g to 3g. You may set the epoch length to be `1 min`, `1 sec`, `5 sec`, `10 sec` and so on.
